## Privacy

**Privacy-first by design.**

Focus Flow Monitor does not employ any external tracking or analytics. Your Browse and time data stays local, stored entirely within your browser's storage, and is never transmitted elsewhere. You have full control over your data, including options to export it, clear it, and set data retention periods.

## Installation

Get the latest **stable version** from the official Firefox Add-ons page:

[**Install Focus Flow Monitor (AMO Stable)**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/focusflow-monitor/)

For the latest features and updates, you can install the **Beta version** directly from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SurajVerma/focus-flow-monitor/releases).

## Beta Version & Data Management

Starting with version 0.9.0.x, the version available on GitHub Releases will be tagged as **beta**. Beta versions are typically identified by a **four-part version number** (e.g., `0.9.0.1`), while stable AMO releases use a three-part version number (e.g., `0.9.0`).

- **Early Access:** Beta versions receive updates and new features first.
- **Testing:** While I test beta versions before releasing, they may contain bugs. Your feedback on these is invaluable!
- **Path to Stable:** These updates, along with any necessary fixes, will later be rolled out to the AMO (Mozilla Add-ons) version as stable releases.

**Important Notes for Beta Users:**

- **Separate Installations:** You can install both the AMO (stable) version and the GitHub (beta) version of Focus Flow Monitor simultaneously in Firefox. They will operate as two distinct extensions.
- **No Shared Data:** The data (tracking history, settings, etc.) is **not shared** between the AMO version and the GitHub beta version. Each installation maintains its own separate local storage.
- **Switching Between Versions:** If you wish to switch from one version to the other (e.g., from AMO to Beta, or Beta to AMO) and want to keep your data, you **must**:
  1.  **Export your data** from the version you are currently using (via the Options page > Data Management > Export All Data).
  2.  **Import that data** into the new version you've installed (via its Options page > Data Management > Import Data from File).

## Usage Notes

- **Tracking Inactivity:** To accurately capture activities like video watching or reading, tracking pauses only when you're inactive (no mouse or keyboard input) for a duration you can configure (default is 30 minutes; options range from 1 minute to 1 hour, or can be disabled).
- **Accessing Options Page:** You can access detailed statistics, manage categories, set site rules (including schedules and block page customization), and configure all settings via the extension's options page.
  - Right-click the extension icon in the Firefox toolbar → "Manage Extension" → "Preferences/Options" (⚙️ icon).
  - Alternatively, click the gear (⚙️) icon in the extension popup.
- **How to use Tomato Clock:**

  - Click on the Focus Flow Monitor icon in your browser toolbar.
  - You'll find the "Tomato Clock" section right in the popup.
  - Click "Start" to begin your first work session!
  - A Pomodoro cycle consists of 4 work sessions, with a short break after each of the first 3 sessions, followed by a long break at the end. The timer will automatically guide you to the next stage—for example, after completing a work session, it will prompt you to start the short break. However, you're free to manually switch between timers if you prefer.
  - The remaining time will appear in the toolbar if the extension is pinned: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64ac383c-0406-4b57-b7ed-da80108d9b83). If you want **Focus Flow Monitor** to notify you when the timer ends, the extension will need notification permissions. You can grant this by clicking the bell icon in the popup which will take you to Tomato Clock settings on the Options page.

- **Active Development:** Focus Flow Monitor is actively maintained and improved. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
